# CLI Task Tracker
A command-line interface (CLI) task tracker that simplifies task management by allowing you to add, view, update, and track the status of your tasks efficiently.


## Features:
- **Add New Tasks**: Easily add tasks with descriptions to your task list.
- **View All Tasks**: List all tasks with their current status (`todo`, `in-progress`, or `done`).
- **Update Task Status**: Update the status of individual tasks.
- **Task Creation Timestamps**: Track when each task was created, along with updates if they occur.
- **Persistent Storage**: Keeps track of all tasks between sessions using JSON storage (`task.json`).
